I want to create a fast, realtime websocket integration with Elevenlabs agents. 

Using the documentation in documentation/*.txt, following their instructions we will be setting up a rasberry pi 4 with Ubuntu 24 LTS server.

Select the best tool for fastest possible use cases. (probably nodejs)

--important notes--

ELEVENLABS_API_KEY={redacted}
AGENT_ID=agent_8701k5jm02g2ek4s8za1j9c3efvp

Development is being done on a windows device with SSH connection to the rasberry pi (ubuntu) device. We will use git to push and pull from the devices for fast code transfer.

You may need to provide me the commands to run in bash for ubuntu to install dependencies etc. 

Hardware:
USB powered microphone: Aduio Technica
Model: ATR2100-USB

Output Device:
{To Be Determined}
